Spotify Big Picture
=================

This Python script modifies Spotify skin.xml to create larger fonts in the Spotify client.

It is mostly useful if Spotify is being used on a larger screen such as a TV with high resolution, 
which results in very small fonts in the Spotify client.

###Linux
```
> sudo python spotifyBigPicture.py
```

###OS X (Not tested)
```
> python spotifyBigPicture.py
